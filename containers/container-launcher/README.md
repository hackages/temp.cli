![screen-shot-2](./docs/media/launcher-container-preferences.png)

#### Default panel
What panel to load by default (when no panel is requested via the URL).

#### Autohide tabs on small screens
To maximize the screen use, the tab strip can be hidden from the view. The Navbar-Advanced has a function to show the tab strip.

#### Hide Panel header on small screens
Since the Navbar-Advanced can already show the title of a panel, it can be hidden here.

#### Fix Default Panel
Makes the default panel to not be hidden when changing to another panel in the tabs. It will be shown in the background.

### Customizing Container Preferences
By changing those preferences it is possible to customize look and behavior of Launcher container

|  Preference name |  Type |  Default value |
|--|--|--|
|  `behaviors` |  string |  lp.retail.RetailBehaviors |
|  `autohideTabs` |  boolean |  true |
|  `autohideHeader` |  boolean |  true |
|  `fixDefaultPanel` |  boolean |  true |

### Panel Preferences

#### Content
Panel could be rendered on the Side panel or in the Main panel:


- 'Side panel (with expanded tab)'
- 'Side panel (with collapsed tab)'
- 'Side panel (tab without chrome)'
- 'Main panel (with simple tab)'
- 'Main panel (with hidden tab)'
- '2nd Level Parent (expanded)'
- '2nd Level Parent (collapsed)'

#### Icon
Value `star` will be rendered as: `<i class="lp-icon lp-icon-star"></i>`

On Panel creation value set to "star", but if value set to the empty sting it will be resolved as "lp-icon-blank" which has no icon assigned.

#### Custom Classes
Gives ability to add custom class names to the tab.

#### Preload Content
If enabled content of the panel will be rendered by the server. If property disabled this will activate "Lazy loading" for the panel. Child elements of a panel will be loaded on panel activation.

#### Hide Chrome
If enabled pane will not have wrapping chrome with "X" button. By default all panes has chrome except "Default panel".
